# Well this is my first digital note that i am making.
=> today I managed to make much strides in doing some kind of work in learning **Next.js** and all of its new features it 
introduced in **Next js 16**.
=> I have just learnt most of the new features like:
- **file based routing** in front-end
```javascript title:all_the_route_types
  /app
     /route-name/page.tsx
     /route-name/[id]/page.tsx
     /(route)/layout.tsx
             /route/page.tsx
  ```
  
  => and more including other conventions like: 
 ```javascript title:normal_conventional_names
loader.tsx
error.tsx
layout.tsx
etc...  
  ```
  
  => and there are many there are many other things that i have just learnt today.
  there are other things that i have learnt like:

  ```javascript title:things_learnt
  chaching on different levels including
  - route level caching
  - component level caching
  - functional level caching
  - server side caching (in order to reduce the api calls and data base calls)
  - client side caching (for more and precise calls from client side)
  ```

# backend
=> on the back-end this implementation is almost the same and the file structure changes a bit. and by this i mean a bit not much. means we just need to create a new folder called "api" inside
the root of the app folder, well this is not necessary but it is a good practice which follows the rule of **separation of concern**. after this it becomes like this.
```js title:api_folder
/app/api
    /route-name/route.ts
    /route-name/[id]/route.ts
```
=> inside of which we just create some functions with name **GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, UPDATE** and more. 
and we can return some things from it just like regular functions that are just like the normal ones and they just become
routes of the application that we
can use in our application or we can just expose them publicly just like we would create in an express server with normal
api calls.
=> the very good thing about NextJs is that it just simplifies a lot of things and the developer experience 
that we get is a huge benefit more ever the overall time of development reduces a lot because i don't
have to work on two different repositories at once and don't have to setup two different development environments at once.
it is a great and very powerful workflow that nextjs provides morever the tooling that get with NextJs.
now i will just try to demonstrate all of the things that i have covered so far in an Excilledraw drawing.
=> [[Drawing 2025-10-29 22.47.43.excalidraw]]
=> after this i wanna make somethings clear as these will make it greatly easy and better to understand after that drawing that it differentiates
=> between frontend and backend routes.

```js  title:Frontend_route_code
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="h-screen flex flex-col px-5 justify-center items-center">
      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-4xl text-center lg:text-5xl bg-linear-to-tr from-red-800 to-blue-800 text-transparent bg-clip-text font-black">
        We Build What Makes You Faster and Better!
      </h1>
      <p>
        We Build What Makes You Faster and Better! We Build What Makes You
        Faster and Better! We Build What Makes You Faster and Better! We Build
        What Makes You Faster and Better! We Build What Makes You Faster and
        Better! We Build What Makes You Faster and Better! We Build What Makes
        You Faster and Better! We Build What Makes You Faster and Better!
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

 - this is the frontend route that defines all of the things we need inside of it. and the backend route looks like this.

```js title:Backend_route_code
import books from "./db";
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json(books);
}
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const book = await request.json();
  books.push(book);
  Response.json(book);
}
```
