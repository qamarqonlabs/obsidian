## The day when ended the MERN (ToolsGallery)

totoday i just completed my MERN stack project and pushed the last commit to github repository, 
am vary happy that i started using obobsidian a and i am also very happy that it has everything that i need to make it 
better way for me to do things like it has vim bindings which i am using right now and it will definitely make me very
happy and will help me to stick with it as i will have to do 0 mental effort to make it into my workflow.
the other good thing is that it does the exactly same thing that as a developer i am most familiar with and that is
backup through github i have created a repo in my github profile and i can now just pupush and pull e everything 
from there right into my obsidian vallet and i am really happy that it merged really well with my workflow.
i am loving this tool very much as well and i am sure that i am going to stay with it for a long time now as well.
now lets assign some tasks to my self for tomorrow.
