I know writing after about **5** days. It is always a bit harder to maintain the routine of doing something, because i have many things to do at the same time. i have to do college work, i have to work on my project, i also have to learn something each day and much more. More on that i have to prepare tests, i know that it seems easy, but i have only 24 hours in a day and i have to do everything including sleep. but good news is that i have worked almost somewhat in good amount on the project, just created the posts page with proper keyboard navigation, focus state, and more.

it has proper keyboard navigation and is accessible.
and the posts grid also has focus state and proper navigation through tab index. currently i dont have any idea that how to enable other navigation like with arrow keys <- ↕ -> and and how to control a grid properly for hover state.
now i am gonna assign some tasks to myself for tomorrow. that i will do.
